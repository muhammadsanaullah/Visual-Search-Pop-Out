## VisualSearch and PopOut Experiment: based on Treisman & Gelade's Theory of Attention in Neuroscience

In 1980, a study was conducted by Treisman and Gelade to test a hypothesis for a feature-integration theory of attention. Understanding the way the mind perceives sensory stimulus into different features helps better understand fundamental concepts in cognitive psychology and neuroscience. The measure of reaction time provides a good insight into the intensities of cognitive processes by seeing how long certain processes take.

The “Visual Search and Pop-Out” experiment does just that, in measuring reaction times to different levels of perceived features in order to make sense of cognitive processes. In the experiment, subjects are asked to report the presence and/or absence of a target stimulus among various different distracting stimuli. Distracting stimuli have different features that involve a “pop-out effect” or “visual searching in conjunction effect”.
